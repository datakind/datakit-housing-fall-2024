This folder contains notebooks and datasets for Florida analysis for Challenge 3.

The files in here (so far!) were created by kodiakpony (Kate Jenkins).

The contents of this folder are as follows:

## Notebooks

### [DataKindChallenge3.ipynb](./DataKindChallenge3.ipynb)
This is the place to start. It's a thorough but hopefully readable investigation into the Challenge 3 "Getting Started" questions.
It's a Google Colab Jupityer notebook, but there is also a PDF if you just want to be able to read it.

#### [DataKindChallenge3-PDF.pdf](./DataKindChallenge3-PDF.pdf)

### [DataKindChallenge3Geo.ipynb](./DataKindChallenge3Geo.ipynb)
A notebook using GeoPandas and Folium to make an interactive Florida map visualizing some of the challenge 3 data

### [DataKindChallenge3Messy.ipynb](./DataKindChallenge3Messy.ipynb)
A sprawling notebook that includes lots of the paths not taken along the road to generating the nicer notebooks in here, but which has useful things amidst the mess. In particular, it includes some invesigations into the CDFI TLR dataset that is the source dataset for the CDFI lending data in EODataScape

### [DataKindChallenge3Simple.ipynb](./DataKindChallenge3Simple.ipynb)
Ignore this one. It is out of date

## Datasets
The rest of the contents of this folder are datasets that I added to augment the DataKit dataset provided as part of the challenge.
