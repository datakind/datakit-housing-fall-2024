This folder contains some notebooks and datasets for Florida analysis.  
The work was mostly done kodiakpony (Kate Jenkins).

The contents of this folder are as follows:
## [DataKindChallenge3.ipynb](./DataKindChallenge3.ipynb)
This is the place to start. It's a thorough but hopefully readable investigation into the Challenge 3 "Getting Started" questions.
It's a Google Colab Jupityer notebook, but there is also a PDF if you just want to be able to read it.
