# Affordable Housing Crisis in the State of Florida

As part of the DataKind challenge, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the affordable housing crisis in the state of Florida for the year 2020. The goal of this research was to uncover insights that could contribute to addressing the pressing issues surrounding housing accessibility and affordability.

In reviewing relevant data and existing research, I encountered several studies that align with the issue, including a study led by the University of Arizona. This study confirms that Black, Hispanic, and low-income populations are disproportionately located in areas at high risk of flooding compared to their white and Asian counterparts. The research, which analyzed over 50,000 property sales in South Florida, explores how ethnicity and income influence homebuyers' decisions regarding high-risk flood zones (Mittan, 2020; Backenssen & Ma, 2020). While DataKind's analysis uses U.S. Census data to explore similar demographic trends, this research underscores the complex intersection of housing affordability and environmental risk.

Motivated by these findings, I sought to explore the data further, creating specific subsets to identify trends within different populations and uncover how these trends intersect with the housing crisis. To facilitate a comprehensive examination of this complex issue, I organized the data into five distinct datasets. Each dataset focuses on specific features and inquiries related to housing accessibility, affordability, and environmental risks. The fifth dataset integrates all the individual datasets, allowing for a broader perspective that combines the insights from each, and providing a more holistic view of the housing crisis.

By examining these factors individually, we can gain a clearer understanding of the specific demographics facing significant barriers to housing. This analysis helps identify at-risk populations and highlights areas where increased state investment may be needed to improve housing stability. Additionally, it provides insight into how certain conditions may make housing unaffordable in areas that are already considered high-risk (Backenssen & Ma, 2020). Ultimately, this approach aims to deliver actionable insights that can inform policy decisions and contribute to a more equitable housing landscape in Florida.

Finally, by analyzing the combined data, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of the barriers to housing that affect residents across different demographics. This holistic analysis uncovers key trends that illustrate how factors such as income levels, environmental risks, and housing affordability intersect to create systemic challenges in accessing stable housing.

It also highlights how environmental risks, such as flooding, and financial constraints are not isolated to specific groups, but instead affect a broader segment of the populationâ€”particularly in regions where flood-prone areas overlap with economically disadvantaged neighborhoods.
